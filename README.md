# Introduction

ByteCog is a python script that aims to help security researchers and others a like to classify malicious software compared to another sample depending on what is the known file is being tested against. This script be extended to use a machine learning model to classify malware in the future. ByteCog uses multiple methods of analyzing and classifying samples given to it, such as using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">Shannon Entropy</a> to give a visual aspect for the researchers to look at while analyzing the code and finding possible readable code/text in a sample. ByteCog also uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance">Hausdorff Distance</a> to calculate a 'raw similarity' value based on the difference in the entropy graphs of both samples, and finally ByteCog uses o-Winkler Distance</a> to calculate the 'true similarity' since the Hausdorff Distance will in most cases return a very high value if the sample is mostly the same entropy wise, so the Jaro-Winkler distance is used to 'adjust' the simliarity value for this case of a sample.

======================================================

usage: bytecog.py [-h] -k KNOWN -u UNKNOWN -i IDENTIFIER -v VISUAL

Determine whether an unknown provided sample is similar to a known sample

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -k KNOWN, --known KNOWN
                        The file path to the known sample
  -u UNKNOWN, --unknown UNKNOWN
                        The file path to the unknown sample
  -i IDENTIFIER, --identifier IDENTIFIER
                        The antivirus identifier of the known file
  -v VISUAL, --visual VISUAL
                        If you want to show a visual representation of the file entropy
 ```

# Features

- Calculates sample similarity
- Generates chunked entropy graph
- Able to *possibly* detect malicious and benign software samples
